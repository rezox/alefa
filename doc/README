Introduction
------------
"alefa" means "run", "go", "launch" or "execute" in malagasy language.

"alefa" is a command line utility that allows to control the launch and execution of other programs.
For example it is often useful to have to write (more or less) simple scripts to rerun some commands until they "succeed", or to launch other commands indefinitely.

There are numerous common use cases, yet it is always when we don't have the time nor the mood to type such scripts that we should. Such things should be easily automated so that we can do other tasks without being distracted and without having to restart such frustrating commands ourselves by hand.

"alefa" fixes that. I decided to create it a day that I was tired of creating, modifying and adapting some scripts to make yet simple and routine tasks.

Examples
--------
Examples abound:
* Try to connect over ssh to a server currently rebooting somewhere in the world, every 5 seconds until it succeeds. In case of connection loss, try again automatically every 5 seconds. When you leave yourself the ssh session by typing "exit", "Alefa" also will stop its attempts and you will return to the prompt.
* Automatically restart a program (command line or graphical app) who crashes regularly
* Regularly check the available disk space during a long copy of huge files etc ..

I use "alefa" every day since its creation in 2008. I decided to publish it, being certain that it will be useful. It already is, but many features will be added progressively, and I'll push them as soon as they are publishable.
So.. feel free to make suggestions based on your daily needs, and please report bugs.
